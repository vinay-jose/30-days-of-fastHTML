# Learning FastHTML in Detail

## Step 1: Set Up Your Learning Environment

1. ~~Install FastHTML and its dependencies~~
2. ~~Create a simple project structure for your learning examples~~

└── README.md                 # Main project documentation

3. ~~Set up version control to track your progress~~

## Step 2: Understand the Core Components

Start with the fundamental building blocks:

1. Study the `FT` (FastTags) components - these form the foundation of how FastHTML renders HTML
2. Explore how FastHTML extends Starlette's functionality
3. Understand the integration with HTMX for dynamic content

## Step 3: Progressive Learning Path

I recommend this sequence:

1. **Basic HTML Generation** - Learn how `FT` components create HTML structure
2. **Routing and Request Handling** - Explore how FastHTML extends Starlette's routing
3. **Dynamic Content** - Study the HTMX integration
4. **Advanced Components** - Examine extended components like `Titled`, `Socials`, etc.
5. **Custom Components** - Learn to create your own components

## Step 4: Create Working Examples

For your tutorial series, I suggest creating examples that demonstrate:

1. A simple "Hello World" application
2. A form-based application with validation
3. A dynamic content application using HTMX
4. A more complex application that uses custom components

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this plan? Or would you prefer more information about a particular aspect of FastHTML?
